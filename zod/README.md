# Instruction for Copilot

## Many of Zod's behaviors and APIs have been made more intuitive and cohesive. The breaking changes described in this folder represent major quality-of-life improvements this project and its developers.

## I cannot emphasize enough how important it is that you are familiar with all the contents of this folder.

## To gain knowledge about the @zod-validation-error extension, read the file zod-validation-error.ts

## To gain knowledge about upgrade from version 3 to 4, read zod-migration.md

## New directives are zod/core, zod/min and features like registry, Codex, metadata and jsonSchema. 

## In addition, it is pointed out that there are many other changes, which also entail the deprecation of much standard functionality, so the attached files are of the highest priority to become familiar with.
