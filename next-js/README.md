## Copilot Instructions

## This folder contains the the orignal and updated documentation from next.js - version 15.

## Pay attention to the use of the "use server" and "use client" directive

## Understand the workflow with Server Funtions, async/await and resolving a promise on the client

## Get to know the build-in functions and  update yourself on their functionality. Many have become asynchronous.

## Examples of changed functions: cookies() from next/headers - is now async. Must therefore be awaited.

## Understand the option with Suspense and how it can be used both for fetching and fallback.

## Components are Server Components as default

## I have activated cacheComponents, typedRoutes and reactCompiler, and are usining unstable_cache + revalidateTag as a main strategy - remember that.

## READ FILE 17-upgrading.md for undestanding the main upgrated features, changes and opportunities.
